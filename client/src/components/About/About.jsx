            <S.Text>My name is Mateusz KÅ‚usek. I'm a full-stack software developer, I work remotely.  </S.Text>
            <S.Text> My current focus is on exploring both ends of websites performance - incredibly fast apps with almost native speed using WebAssembly written in Rust for modern devices with very fast internet connection on one side and websites that require a distinct separation between main thread mainly for repaint and reflow job and separately-spawn threads for computing for old devices with slow internet connection on the other side. </S.Text>
            <S.Text>My technology stack includes but it's not limited to: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/Typescript, Node.js, React, MongoDB, WebAssembly and Rust.</S.Text>
            <S.Text>I speak english and polish.</S.Text>
